		  <p>Benjamin Franklin was a master of the art of productivity. As a polymath, he wore many different hats during his lifetime: author, printer, entrepreneur, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, inventor, and diplomat to name a few.</p>
		  <p>What was his secret to becoming so successful? </p>
		  <p>Undoubtedly, a lot of it was down to his own hard work and determination.</p>
		  <p>In his autobiography, however, he shares a technique that helped him stay focused on his goals: a daily schedule.</p>

		<p class="text-center">Every morning he asked himself, "What good shall I do today?"</p>
		<p class="text-center">Every night he asked himself, "What good have I done today?"</p>
		<p id="tribute-info">This is Benjamin Franklin’s actual daily routine. This is how he lived his life every day, well he followed the same routine as often as possible. This steady regimen provided the balance necessary in his life to accomplish all those other great things we read about.  To incorporate his ways into your daily life, experimentation is necessary, you need to find what works for you.</p>

		  <p>Nearly everything on Franklin’s list is selfish. The foundation of his daily schedule is himself. It’s only after he takes care of himself that he focuses on work and doing a good deed for others. If you’re not taking care of yourself, you’re likely not doing as much good as you think. You can’t disconnect from yourself, so make sure you keep you up and running at all times.</p>

		  <p>Organizing where everything goes is essential. At the end of every day, Ben Franklin put his toys back in their box, just like your mom made you do as a kid. This is because a messy work space is counterintuitive to actual work. When you keep your things organized, you feel less flustered, and you’re less likely to make impulsive decisions.</p>

		  <p>This simple practice of evaluating his day every morning and evening helped Franklin put everything into perspective. Even if he hadn’t accomplished everything that he wanted to, he was able to spend time celebrating his victories. Exams are mandatory, Question everything; just don’t overthink yourself or you’ll end up never doing anything.</p>

		  <p>Franklin asked himself every evening whether or not he accomplished his goals. By keeping track, he holds himself responsible. There are no excuses. Be accountable for your goals. The cigarette you sneak, the candy bar you don’t tell people in your Zumba class about, it’s all hurting yourself and no one else. If even you won’t listen to you, who else will?</p>
